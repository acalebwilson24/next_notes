getStaticProps - for truly static page data which will not change between builds
getServerSideProps - 


NextJS Approaches - 
Static Generation - use for pages with no data which will change regularly (fastest, can be cached easily)
Static Generation + Client-Side Rendering - skip pre-rendering for certain parts of the page and populate on the Client. Seems like default behaviour when 
                                            rendering pages with client-side fetching.
Server-Side rendering - fetches data on each request and renders on server, sending html file
